# Community Constitution

The Fellowship of the Ring (FoR) community has been formed to give contributors a collaborative way to contribute to the Looping project in an officially sponsored capacity. The community is free to choose how best they would like to contribute so long as it is for the overall betterment of both the Loopring project and the FoR community. The FoR council will set an approximate set of goals for projects that are in line with the Loopring project roadmap.

The initial structure of FoR will be as follows:

1. The FoR community will be lead by a council, made up of 7 seats.
2. Amongst the 7 council seats, 3 seats will make up the high council.
3. Anyone can apply for a FoR membership after contributing in a meaningful way. Generally this means by contributing to FoR’s github repositories via pull requests.

General Guidelines:

4. All members, council and high council are free to continue to work for outside organizations and contribute to other open source projects, without limitation.
5. Any pull request submitted to FoR’s github is eligible for a reward (determined by a vote by the council) once it is approved and merged into the codebase.

Council Guidelines:

6. All general voting shall be done by the entire council and requires a minimum 2/3 majority to pass, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
7. The council shall be responsible for the final review of pull requests before they are merged into the FoR repositories.
8. The high council shall be responsible for reviewing all changes before opening a pull request to the Loopring repositories once a week.
9. The high council shall be responsible for maintaining the council. Including, but not limited to, the nomination of members to vacant council seats followed by the initiation of a vote of the council, interactions with the Loopring team, and bringing structural changes up for vote.
10. All reward distribution will be drafted by the high council and presented to the council for a vote.
11. A council, or high council member can choose to step down at any time.
12. A council, or high council seat can be revoked for reasons including, but not limited to, lack of involvement or misconduct. The process for revoking a seat requires the approval of at least 5 council members.

Council Transition:

13. The initial council will consist of 3 community members in the high council seats as well as 3 Loopring members in an advisory capacity. The Loopring members agree to withdraw their council membership by no later than April 2018. After those seats have been filled by new council members, an election will be held amongst the council to choose the new high council structure.
14. The high council members can be re-elected an unlimited number of times by the council.
15. Once begun, high council elections will be held on a quarterly basis.
